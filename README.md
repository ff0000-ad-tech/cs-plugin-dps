AdTech - Particles
----------------------------------------------------------------

Ad Particles is a particle system in Ad HTML( https://stash.ff0000.com/projects/AT/repos/ad-html/browse/_adlib/core/js/view/particleSystem?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fparticles ) to enable implementing particle effects more efficiently. It works with a Particle Simulator( https://stash.ff0000.com/projects/AT/repos/ad-particles/browse ) that can be launched through AdApp. The Simulator provides a visual interface to tweak effects in real time. There are more complex and dynamic effects can be achieved programmatically.
